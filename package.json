  "description": "A ludo board game I built out of just wanting to create something I can play with on my computer. It has all the features and all the rules of a standard ludo game although I broke some since I was not able to implement them. Its presently an offline 2 player game... Hopefully, in future, I'd like to add a little bit of machine learning so as to be able to play with the computer and also be able to play the game online with friend. I'd appreciate a honest feedback",
